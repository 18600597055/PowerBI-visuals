To access your visual through PowerBI, you need to add a trusted certificate for localhost. This will allow PowerBI to load the visual assets in your browser without a security warning.

### Adding Certificate

* [Windows](../add-certificate-windows/)
* [OSX](../add-certificate-mac-os-x/)

### Removing Certificate

If you are no longer using the PowerBI Custom Visual CLI tools, you should remove the certificate from your system.

* [Windows](../remove-certificate-windows/)
* [OSX](../remove-certificate-mac-os-x/)
