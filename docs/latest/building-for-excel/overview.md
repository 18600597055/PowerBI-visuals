### General Thoughts 

minimal and expand with input from developer community. 

single high level page on the critical items for building a visual for office (comparable to PBI’s page https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-custom-visuals-getting-started-with-developer-tools) 

Office document would reference PBI’s content and augment with critical office items 

Links are based off PBI’s current git documentation not the draft git.io content (draft git will becoming main one soon)
