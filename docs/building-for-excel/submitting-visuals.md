Custom visuals for Excel is in preview, and users cannot access visuals from the Office store.  
Revisit this page for updates on submitting your custom visual as an Excel add-in once the store becomes available.

Until then, **you can still submit visuals for use in Power BI!**  Learn how to submit a custom visual to the Power BI visuals gallery [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/office-store).
