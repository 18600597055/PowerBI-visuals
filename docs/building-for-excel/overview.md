We want developers to bring the same great enthusiasm to data visualization in Excel that you brought to Power BI!

The custom visuals feature is currently in preview.  We want developers to start testing their existing Power BI visuals in Excel, writing new visuals to work in both Power BI and Excel, and [**give us feedback**](../give-feedback/) on the overall experience.   Weâ€™ll continue to build on the capabilities, user and developer experiences, and documentation as we ready custom visuals for all Office 365 users.  Getting a head start now means your visual will be ready for users when custom visuals becomes generally available and means you can help shape how we expand the feature.

As a preview, custom visuals are only available to Office 365 users that are:
